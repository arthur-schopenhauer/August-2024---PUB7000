AB  - Abstract Forums play a crucial role in how polycentric governance systems adapt by allowing actors to deliberate on how to respond to exogenous change. However, the exact role of forums remains unclear, as prior studies on polycentric governance often examine different types of actors and network structures separately. To address this issue, we combine insights from actor and network level analyses to compare how actors in three Dutch metropolitan areas use forum shifting, shopping, and linking as strategies to create and adjust forums in response to a change in national spatial policy. We find that actors create and adjust forums through a combination of strategies. Combining strategies not only helps to create and adjust forums but also legitimizes their existence. Which strategies are combined depends on the interaction between actors that are both resource rich and highly active, and how these actors are positioned in a particular polycentric governance network.

AB  - Abstract Recent years have shown that strategic responses to crises by local governments (LGs) depend on the type of crisis, the institutional environment, but also internal capacities and sensemaking processes. However, such relationships have not been tested widely yet. Based on a survey of managers (n?=?590) from cities with more than 15,000 inhabitants in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, this study explores the role played by specific organizational capacities (critical thinking, bricolage, and financial capacities) and crisis perceptions (valence?i.e., threat vs. opportunity; and controllability) in shaping adaptive or regressive response strategies. Results show that these capacities are associated with how LGs' managers perceive crises and the type of responses adopted. Higher financial capacity, bricolage, and critical thinking are associated with stronger sense of organizational controllability, but they have different relationships with threat and opportunity perceptions. The study confirms the importance of distinguishing valence (threat and opportunity) from controllability perceptions.

AB  - Abstract Recent years have seen a step-change in the severity and nature of threats to United States democracy, including extensive efforts by elected officials to undercut democratic governance. When elected officials undermine democracy, this constitutes ?deformation of democracy.? As implementors and agents of policy, public administrators can sometimes play essential roles as bulwarks against democratic deformation. However, among public administrators there is historically a strong ethos emphasizing neutral competence and subordination to political authority, in some cases reinforced by law. How should public administrators respond when confronted by deformation and, at the same time, constrained by tradition and law? We selectively review strands of public administration theory, focusing on theory especially relevant to the United States governmental system, to construct and assess a catalog of responses that public administrators can take under democratic deformation. We conclude by offering a set of recommendations focused on institutionalized collective action by public administrators.

AB  - Abstract Local authorities today cope with environmental changes. As urbanization advances, the overlap between nature and the world of human beings increases. The resulting new interactions between humans and wild animals have many consequences. The perspectives of public administration and politics regarding this issue remain unexplored. There is limited research on local environmental crises and local environmental governance regarding the interactions between people and animals in the management of urban spaces. Therefore, we conducted a study using the presence of wild boars in Haifa, Israel. It tests the impact of support for the incumbent mayor through the mediated relationship of the harm caused by wild animals and the moderating effect of local governance on local political participation. Our findings may advance current theory to local administration and local environmental governance. On a practical level, policymakers can design effective local environmental governance, and promote behaviors on the part of politicians and residents.

AB  - Abstract The pandemic era ushered in a period of policy adaptation in how states deliver programs. One aspect of this experimentation is how burdensome safety net administrative processes should be. Using national surveys taken before and after the end of the public health emergency, we offer evidence of how tolerant the public is about burdens when allowed to choose between discrete policy implementation options. First, we show that burden tolerance beliefs are durable and largely unmovable, staying relatively consistent over time, and unaffected by experimental frames. Second, while there is varying support for specific strategies, the public is broadly supportive of tools that reduce burdens in Medicaid. Third, we find consistent predictors of burden tolerance: conservative beliefs and racial resentment are associated with support for burdens, while empathy toward others, belief in burdens as a form of systemic racism, and low administrative capital make people less tolerant of burdens.

We offer four principles that guide abductive analysis: (i) embrace surprises, tensions, and doubts; (ii) use knowledges creatively to theorize; (iii) craft through methodological bricolage; and (iv) iterate through the research process. In addition, we discuss the implications of abductive analysis for how we learn, craft, and reflect on qualitative research.

AB  - Abstract Following PRISMA guidelines, this study offers a systematic review of 78 articles on person-environment (P-E) fit in the public sector. The study reveals both an emphasis on supplementary person-organization (P-O) fit and its relationship to public service motivation (PSM). We also find evidence of both bottom-up and top-down processes that mutually adjust to determine fit over time. Building on these findings, we propose an integrative theory that models the multidimensionality of fit as mutual adjustment between the person and the environment along three major dimensions: values, needs, and skills. Integrating the temporal dynamics of the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model, we demonstrate how these dimensions interact and generally settle upon an equilibrium over time, which we define as P-E fit.

AB  - Abstract Public administration research has recently paid increasing attention to public employees' social categorization of citizens and the consequences thereof for administrative decision-making. We advance this line of scholarship by theorizing the concept of implicit citizenship theories (ICTs) and elaborating it in four sequential empirical studies. ICTs are implicit assumptions about citizens' typical or ideal characteristics that emerge freely and associatively in the minds of public employees and guide cognitive categorization. We investigate the content and structure of these ICTs and extract a taxonomy of six distinctive, yet interrelated, prototypes of citizens that public employees bring to their jobs. As implicit theories influence attitudes and behaviors, ICTs are relevant to the quality of public services delivered to citizens. This is particularly evident where negative prototypes give rise to unequal treatment. Practical interventions to change those prototypes might target their individual beholders or the social context that makes ICTs accessible.

AB  - Abstract The emergence of the administrative burden literature has generated new theoretical, conceptual, and empirical knowledge. However, the accumulation of comparable knowledge is limited by the lack of validated measurement of core concepts. This article validates a four-item scale of burden tolerance, that is, people's acceptance of state actions that impose administrative burdens on citizens and residents interacting with government, using data from seven countries and 12 surveys. We illustrate the usefulness of the scale by examining its correlates. Burden tolerance varies substantially across the countries examined, but is generally higher for males, young adults, less well educated, those with good health, those who trust state actors more, and ideological conservatives. We demonstrate how the scale can be adapted to specific policy areas and that our generic scale correlates highly with the tolerance for burdens in such diverse domains as income supports, health insurance, passport renewals, and small business licensing.

We replicate experimentally James et al.'s blame study to assess whether the findings still apply in the original, Western context, and if the findings can be generalized to East Asia (Hong Kong and South Korea). Our replications (N?=?3600) show support for contracting out to the private sector as an effective institutional arrangement for politicians to avoid blame?providing evidence for this hypothesized effect that was not found by the original study in England. Blame shift effects are typically weaker in East Asia as anticipated because of cultural differences. Overall, the findings show that politicians can use cues about delegation to reduce citizens' blame for service failure, but that such strategies vary in their success according to context.

AB  - Abstract This study analyzes public administrators' trust in citizens' capacities to participate in governance, their collaborative tendency, and the association between these factors and public administrators' willingness to implement citizen involvement efforts. The purpose of the study is to examine whether public administrators' trust in citizens' participatory capacities predicts a willingness to implement citizen participation efforts within the central administration of a Nordic welfare country. The central administration of Finland presents a counter case to previous studies, which have mostly focused on the United States. A unique survey of administrators, operationalized similarly to previous studies, was conducted, and analysis of the data provides both confirmatory and novel insights. The analysis finds that administrators' trust in citizens' participatory capacities strongly predicts their willingness to implement citizen participation initiatives. However, this relation can significantly decrease or increase depending on the degree to which administrators value the procedural legitimacy of collaborative governance.

AB  - Abstract It is not easy to secure and sustain efficient interorganizational collaboration in hierarchically demarcated and functionally specialized public sectors. This article investigates whether and how public leaders can motivate and catalyze their own employees to engage in behaviors that foster and support collaboration across organizational jurisdictions. Using survey data from 555 occupational therapists in Danish municipalities, we employed an innovative scenario-based research design including video vignettes and a centipede game to mimic real-life collaboration. We show that clear and collaboration-focused leadership has a positive and substantial effect on employees' engagement in an interorganizational collaboration with a regionally employed nurse. Further, the effects are stronger for respondents with higher public service motivation, higher collaborative self-efficacy, more tenure, and at a younger age. The findings contribute to understanding public leadership and employee engagement in interorganizational collaboration and emphasize that leaders should carefully consider their context and communication when engaging their employees.

AB  - Abstract This paper serves as a renewed call for public management scholars and public leaders in liberal democracies to be the champions of accountability standards that are explicitly and implicitly inherent to liberal democratic forms of governance. This call is particularly salient amid increasing populism, polarization, and democratic backsliding. Drawing from the historical and contemporary political and legal philosophies of small-l liberalism and democracy advanced throughout the ages, we define a set of seven liberal democratic accountability standards focusing on matters of authority, rights, tolerance, truth claims, and professional deference. We then consider how these standards relate to some of public administration and management's ongoing considerations of the politics-administration dichotomy, citizen engagement, and network governance, and make the case for more explicit focus on liberal democratic accountability standards in public management scholarship.

AB  - Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to the joint organizational response of private and public and here especially public health organizations. This is particularly true for airports as central connectors of global travel and trade. For five European airports, we analyzed the interorganizational response based on input from 66 of the 87 different airport partners, using two fictitious scenarios derived from public health practice. We applied organizational design theory and quantitative (network) analysis to show how the four fundamental problems of organizing have been tackled at airports, i.e., task distribution, task allocation, rewards, and information provision. This article shows how the response to COVID-19 in the airport setting needs to be solved within broad and flexible public administrative networks. The thorough understanding of organizational network responses in emergency management following from this article supports future preparedness efforts to deal with complex known and unknown public health threats.

AB  - Abstract Numerous studies associate ethical leadership with ethical behavior in the public sector. By contrast, the effects of unethical leadership in the public sector have largely not been explored. Yet, unethical leadership need not beget unethical followership. Instead, we theorize that some bureaucrats may perceive unethical leadership as a moral threat and respond to it with moral compensation and greater ethical behavior. We provide evidence for our theorized effect through a vignette experiment with 19,852 bureaucrats in Chile. Bureaucrats exposed in the vignette to unethical role modeling by their superior or peers react with greater ethical awareness and ethical intent. This effect is concentrated among bureaucrats recruited through merit-based, public service criteria rather than connections, and thus bureaucrats who more likely feel morally threatened by unethical leadership. This suggests that unethical leadership in the public sector may differ in its consequences from the mere absence of ethical leadership.

By analyzing data from interviews and participatory observations of public encounters in a social security administration context, we propose a typology of public encounters based on clients' and employees' preparedness that affects the dynamics and outcomes of services. Encounters can either be characterized by ?Conflict and Obstruction,? ?Advocacy,? ?Case Processing,? or ?Agreement and Collaboration.? We conceptualize the relation between these types and how both clients and caseworkers transition between them. Additionally, the article's findings suggest that public encounters should not be observed as singular events. Rather, spillover effects between encounters and long-term multi-episode interactions with clients prove to be essential in understanding behavior on both sides through mutual learning.

It represents an aspiration for a better and more efficient administration but also presents challenges to values of public administration. We systematically review the emerging literature on use of AADM from the perspective of good governance. Recognizing the inherent tensions of values of public administration, the broad review identifies key synergies, trade-offs, and limits of AADM and good governance associated with nine values: Accountability, efficiency, equality, fairness, resilience, responsiveness, right-to-privacy, rule-of-law, and transparency. While synergies represent ?low-hanging fruits?, trade-offs and limits are ?hard cases? representing challenges to good governance. Taking the specific decision-making context into account, practitioners and scholars should attempt to nurture the ?fruits? and lessen the tensions of the ?hard-cases? thereby increasing the desirable societal outcomes of use of AADM.

AB  - Abstract Liberal democracy has become vulnerable to illiberal political movements and the gradual erosion of democratic institutions. To safeguard liberal democracy, we propose the concept of the Guardian State, which embraces liberal principles while acting as a defensive barrier against illiberal tendencies. We need strong administrative institutions that uphold liberal democratic norms and resist pressures from populist politicians. Institutionalizing guardianship as the key norm within the civil service fortifies democratic institutions against backsliding. The principle of neutrality alone cannot ensure that only liberal citizens come to power. Structural measures at the individual and organizational levels are essential to fortify the foundations of the Guardian State and protect liberal democracy against evolving threats. Proactive efforts are necessary to defend and strengthen the public service to ensure the long-term viability of democratic governance. The Guardian State places the bureaucracy in a key role in preserving the core principles of democracy.

AB  - Abstract The literature on administrative burdens demonstrates that citizens may experience different kinds of administrative burdens when interacting with the state. However, we know little about whether citizens' communication of these experiences affects how frontline employees implement compliance demands. Building on the street-level bureaucracy and administrative burden literature, we hypothesize that citizens' communication of direct and indirect psychological costs affects frontline employees' inclination to accommodate citizens. Furthermore, we expect this effect to be stronger for members of the ethnic majority than for ethnic minority members. We test these expectations using a preregistered survey experiment on a sample of 1048 Danish public caseworkers from 32 employment agencies. Results show that frontline employees are indeed more willing to reduce demands and help citizens that communicate their experiences of direct and indirect psychological costs. Further, we find some evidence that frontline employees are more responsive to citizens from the ethnic majority.

AB  - Abstract Nonprofit and for-profit providers play an increasing role in public service delivery, but we know little about what shapes public service delivery preferences. Responding to calls to put the ?public? back in public values theory, we examine the influence of public values on sector service delivery preferences for government, nonprofit, or for-profit delivery across six service areas ranging from simple services such as trash collection to complex services such as child welfare. We find equity predicts a preference for government service delivery across areas, while efficiency corresponds to a preference for for-profit service delivery. Nonprofit sector preferences varied across service areas; equity corresponds to simple services such as street maintenance, whereas effectiveness corresponds to complex human services such as elder care. Public administrators should be cognizant of the public value trade-offs that underlie sector preferences for public services to design and implement service arrangements in line with the preferences of the public they serve.

I examine this question through a case study of community dialogues about policing, safety, race, and White privilege after Philando Castile was killed by a police officer. Through longitudinal, ethnographic analysis, I trace how a series of deliberative dialogues made White complicity in racism visible, leading to problem-solution pathways expanding beyond an initial focus on policing reform to also incorporate White residents' making deeper commitments to anti-racism and inclusion. This shift occurred through the sequencing of topics, slowing down the pace of problem definition, building relationships, dialogue norms and facilitation methodologies, and BIPOC participants' labor. I conclude with suggestions for more constructive democratic processes to support anti-racist governance.

AB  - Abstract Agile refers to a work management ideology with a set of productivity frameworks that support continuous and iterative progress on work tasks by reviewing one's hypotheses, working in a human-centric way, and encouraging evidence-based learning. In practice, public administrations have started to use agile principles and methods to plan projects, work in short sprints, iterate after receiving feedback from stakeholders, and apply a human-centric approach to arrive at prototyped solutions. To understand the opportunities and challenges public servants perceive when they are asked to apply agile work practices, I conducted focus groups to study the social affordances of agile governance that need to be in place for public servants to adopt an agile mindset and its related practices. As a result of the exposure to agile work practices, public servants are either able to perceive its affordances and are willing to adopt agile, they falsely perceive them or they even remain hidden from them leading to a rejection of agile.

AB  - Abstract This article examines the impact of partnership design on technological innovation in public-private innovation partnerships. It develops two competing hypotheses on how specific partnership characteristics lead to innovation in health care services. The study compares 19 eHealth partnerships across five European countries and uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to test the hypotheses. The findings show that small, centralized, and homogeneous partnerships are most successful at achieving technological innovation. The study highlights the importance of partnership design in spurring innovation and calls for a reconsideration of some of the underlying assumptions of collaborative innovation theory.

AB  - Abstract Literature reviews have become widespread in public administration, especially in the past decade. These reviews typically adopt widely-accepted approaches with many drawing upon systematized approaches to review in fields like medicine and psychology. Public administration, however, is a professional, design-oriented discipline, focused on enhancing theory to solve real-life policy, administrative, and managerial challenges. Recognizing the unique traditions and purposes in public administration scholarship, it is important to take stock of how public administration scholars ?do? reviews, with the aim of providing recommendations to rejuvenate the state of the art in reviewing. We present a framework to guide review efforts in public administration centered on purpose (why?), object (what?), subject (who?), community (for whom?) and practices (how?). Next, we present different approaches to doing reviews and how those approaches present different answers to the questions raised above. Finally, we discuss examples of public administration reviews within each approach and conclude with specific recommendations for researchers and practitioners who want to use reviews to rejuvenate public administration.

AB  - Abstract This article studies in how far participation of stakeholders enhances their active support for place brands, conceptualized in this study as Brand Citizenship Behavior (BCB). Combining insights from governance and branding theory this article uses survey data (N?=?162) among stakeholders involved in branding processes of two Dutch regions. The analysis shows that more intense participation in the development of the brand is related to more BCB. Beyond participation, perceived value of the brand for stakeholders and degree of place identity (identification with place) also positively relate to brand citizenship behavior. The findings not only confirm the importance of participation in achieving support for public brands, but also provide insight into the role of affective factors (identification) and interest-based factors (value of the brand for the stakeholder) on BCB.

AB  - Abstract Although transparency is recognized as an important public value, few studies examine how citizens see the relationship between transparency and other public values. To empirically investigate this relationship, we distinguish among five types of transparency and explore their associations with different views of ?good? government and other public values. Using survey data and Q methodology, we find that citizens see transparency as an important value, albeit not the most important one. We also find that people give different weight to different kinds of transparency and that this depends on individual characteristics and on their overall value orientation or conception of ?good? government. In particular, those who hold a contractarian view of democracy prefer types of transparency associated with accountability. Overall, transparency as candor is valued most highly and least associated with other value preferences?suggesting an important interpretation of transparency that has been hitherto neglected in the literature.

AB  - Abstract We conducted three randomized experiments to investigate whether and to what extent citizens' expectations toward waiting times for public service delivery are influenced by reference points, either in the form of social or numerical references. Consistent with our theoretical expectations, our results provide convergent evidence of reference dependence. Specifically, informing citizens that waiting times are longer (shorter) relative to a social reference causes an increase (decrease) in expected waiting times. Additionally, due to an anchoring bias, priming citizens with a higher numerical value for waiting times extends their expected waiting times. Furthermore, in line with the expectancy-disconfirmation model, citizens' satisfaction with the service is causally impacted by the extent to which actual performance exceeds their expectations.

AB  - Abstract Public sector creativity?public servants coming up with novel and useful ideas?is the origin of solutions and innovations central to public sector organizations' ability to optimally serve society's interests. Despite its relevance and argued limitations, an adequate scale and framework to assess public servants' creativity remained absent. Using three quantitative (n?=?2434/n?=?1157/n?=?621) and two qualitative datasets, this state-of-the-art preregistered study provides a novel, valid, reliable, comprehensive but succinct multidimensional measurement tool allowing detailed assessment of states and changes of public servants' creativity by academics and practitioners. To aid academics and practitioners' understanding of the scale and public sector creativity, it also provides a supplementary theoretical framework in line with the data structure of the scale that compresses and structures extant theory on creativity while emphasizing what is indicated as important in the public sector. The findings shed light on the nature of public sector creativity as an aggregate and multidimensional construct.

AB  - Abstract Many of the fundamental research questions in public administration relate to individual- or organization-level temporal dynamics, including the impact of public sector reforms, (in)stability of public policies and organizations, development of public service motivation, or the workplace socialization of public employees. However, theoretical, methodological, and empirical public administration scholarship continues to take time and temporal dynamics insufficiently seriously. This constitutes a major shortcoming within the profession and implies that we are yet to unlock the transformative potential of longitudinal research. Building on the recent development of novel research infrastructures that can support the study of temporal dynamics of?and within?public organizations, this Symposium pushes for a ?longitudinal turn? in the study of public administration. We maintain that more concerted efforts to apply a temporal lens to our research endeavors are critical to theorize, empirically assess, and understand public administrations as well as the bureaucrats employed within them.

AB  - Abstract Drawing on the sense of community responsibility concept, we explore the enterprise policy ecosystem in an extensive qualitative study of Scotland. We present a processual model which explains how policies are shaped in an on-going dynamic through street-level managers' individual agency. Our findings reveal that driving the process is an interplay between personal motives (compassion, relational strength, esteem, coherence) with a social frame of reference (policy group, locality, public organization) which is based on embeddedness within specific policy contexts. This interplay guides how managers translate policy as either an opportunity or a threat which then directs how they enact their discretion to adapt, advocate change, or resist implementation. This process offers an explanation as to how situated value is created for specific policy areas within public service ecosystems. The implications are discussed in relation to the existing literature on policy implementation.

AB  - Abstract Structural duration conveys stability but also resilience in central government and is therefore a key issue in the debate on the structure and organization of government. This paper discusses three core variants of structural duration to study the explanatory relevance of politics. We compare these durations across ministerial units in four European democracies (Germany, France, The Netherlands, and Norway) from 1980 to 2013, totaling over 17,000?units. Our empirical analyses show that cabinets' ideological turnover and extremism are the most significant predictors of all variants of duration, whereas polarization in parliament as well as new prime ministers without office experience yield the predicted significant negative effects for most models. We discuss these findings and avenues for future research that acknowledge the definition and measures for structural change as well as temporal aspects of the empirical phenomenon more explicitly.

AB  - Abstract Administrative tasks often are an unavoidable aspect of the daily work of street-level bureaucrats (SLBs). These burdensome tasks are job demands that can cause stress and put a strain on SLBs' working experience and performance. So far, few studies have searched for job resources that can help SLBs cope with this aspect of their daily work. This study analyzes how performing administrative tasks results in job stress. Participation in organizational decision-making is presented as a job resource that mitigates this impact?although, we hypothesize, less so in countries with high power distance. Using a survey dataset of 113,210 teachers across 46 countries, we find that participation in organizational decision-making indeed reduces the impact of spending time on administrative tasks on job stress. Power distance does not influence this moderation significantly but does have cross-level interactions with both the time spent on administrative tasks and the level of participation separately.

AB  - Abstract Does collective citizen input impact government priorities and performance in service provision? As cities increasingly offer interactive issue reporting options through online platforms and mobile apps, I investigate whether comments and follows on requests drive faster issue resolution. I theorize that this input signals issue validity, severity, or scrutiny, assisting city administrators in prioritizing and responding to requests. Leveraging a novel dataset of requests from 100 cities, I find that comments and follows double the probability of request closure and that collaborative requests are resolved up to 5?days faster on average than non-collaborative requests. By comparing two cities that use the same platform but that differ in the observability of citizen collaboration, I isolate a distinct and significant influence of collective citizen input on government responsiveness. The findings speak to how technological advances enable information-sharing from citizens that can shape service delivery rules and outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Research suggests that citizens often abstain from taking up benefits for which they are eligible because of the costs of learning about how to apply for and the compliance and psychological costs associated with taking up benefits. But to what extent can such burdens be altered simply by changing the way rules are communicated? Bridging literatures on administrative burden, communication theory, and cognitive psychology, we theorize and test the causal impact (using a pre-registered randomized survey experiment (N?=?2243)) of two prominent aspects of rule communication: information structure and bureaucratic language. Our findings lend support to the expectation that bureaucratic language influences citizens' learning costs as well as their compliance ? and to a lesser extent psychological ? costs, even when the content of the rules communicated is the same.

AB  - Abstract Law enforcement agencies are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools. While prior work emphasizes the technological features driving public opinion, we investigate how public trust and support for AI in government vary with the institutional context. We administer a pre-registered survey experiment to 4200 respondents about AI use cases in policing to measure responsiveness to three key institutional factors: bureaucratic proximity (i.e., local sheriff versus national Federal Bureau of Investigation), algorithmic targets (i.e., public targets via predictive policing versus detecting officer misconduct through automated case review), and agency capacity (i.e., necessary resources and expertise). We find that the public clearly prefers local over national law enforcement use of AI, while reactions to different algorithmic targets are more limited and politicized. However, we find no responsiveness to agency capacity or lack thereof. The findings suggest the need for greater scholarly, practitioner, and public attention to organizational, not only technical, prerequisites for successful government implementation of AI.

AB  - Abstract Bureaucrats must balance neutral competence with responsiveness to external demands. As external demands are simultaneous and multidimensional, this study analyzes bureaucratic responsiveness according to bureaucratic actors' prioritization decisions. Using a discrete choice experiment followed by qualitative interviews in the context of EU agencies, we investigate to what extent bureaucratic responsiveness depends upon the stakeholder that expresses an external demand (source), the aspect of bureaucratic conduct that is addressed (content), and the presence of adverse media attention (salience). In addition to corroborating prior empirical findings, we provide a novel understanding of bureaucratic responsiveness by showing the way demands' source and content affect responsiveness jointly. Across the range of technical, performative, legal-procedural, and moral demands, we identify which stakeholders can impose demands most authoritatively. We also extend previous research by demonstrating that adverse media attention strengthens responsiveness to technical and moral demands, but not to performative and legal-procedural demands.

Using attribution theory, this study examines how police officers interpret negative stakeholder feedback and how these interpretations shape their behavioral responses. Qualitative analysis based on 148 interviews with European police officers shows that officers make six different attributions about the causes of stakeholder critique, and that these have direct implications for their behavioral responses. In particular, these different attribution patterns are found to play a critical and hitherto unrecognized role in shaping police-stakeholder relations and organizational learning among police forces.

AB  - Abstract As a human capital crisis poses urgent challenges across multiple countries, public administration scholars and practitioners are concerned with recruitment and selection questions. Literature evolves with an increasing pace whereby clarity over the state-of-the-art and gaps in recruitment and selection research in the public sector is needed to direct future research and practice. We conducted a review of 59 studies to systematize and reorient research on recruitment and selection. Summarizing the state-of-the-art, we identify a strong focus on individual-level research of attraction, revealing several blind spots of research on other levels and process stages of hiring. Based on the synthesis of existing knowledge, we provide a research agenda that extends the predominant focus on attraction. By bridging public administration concepts with generic recruitment and selection research, the agenda aims at advancing the research on hiring in the public sector, offering a framework for levels, concepts/theories, processes, and key variables.

Only a few attempts have been made to review the theories applied in PA broadly and systematically, to take stock of the theoretical repertoire, and to engage scholars in critical reflection on how they ?do? theorizing. This study analyzes the theoretical landscape of PA scholarship with a novel combination of bibliometrics and natural language processing. A ?tree of theories? shows how 150 theories merge into one body of scholarship, with 15 theories at the core. The theories vary considerably in terms of disciplinary background, methodological choices, geographical settings, author diversity, and reach beyond academia. While the results indicate the plurality and vitality of the field, they also raise concerns about how core theories show limited geographical dispersion and low societal relevance. These concerns are further fueled by an apparent schism between micro and macro theories.

AB  - Abstract In four online experiments involving 16,461 public professionals, we examined the causal effects of reciprocity styles at work on colleagues' expected job satisfaction and motivation. Our findings indicate that giving, which involves helping others when the benefit outweighs personal cost, is the supervisory reciprocity style that maximizes expected satisfaction among subordinates (Study 1). Additionally, it is expected that public employee motivation will be highest when their supervisor or colleagues exhibit a giving reciprocity style. Interestingly, the positive motivational effect of a giving peer is found to be relatively larger than that of a giving supervisor (Study 2). Furthermore, the expected motivation of current team members is enhanced by the prospect of a giver joining their unit, while the arrival of a taker (someone who only helps if the benefits exceed personal costs) reduces colleagues' motivation compared to the departure of a taker (Study 3).

AB  - Abstract After a relatively slow policy intervention and scholarly take-up, recent developments created the urgency for massive efforts to implement and regulate telework in public organizations. We contribute to this debate through a systematic review of 120 studies across disciplines. Findings from our analysis reveal a few established antecedents of telework, including individual characteristics like family responsibilities and expected productivity, but also organizational aspects like supportive leadership, and contextual features like natural disasters. Self-reported productivity and work-life balance stand out as telework's most widely studied outcomes, although evidence is often conflicting when coming to the effects of telework. We present our results by distinguishing pre- and post-pandemic findings. Complementing our systematic review, we engage in a generative exercise by identifying emerging debates on telework in public bureaucracies. We conclude by indicating future research directions.

The findings reveal that a significant proportion of work is centered around performance management and policy implementation. Notably, around one third of the reviewed studies adopt a behavioral science perspective. The analysis predominantly includes civil servants and citizens as the subjects, with quantitative studies outnumbering qualitative investigations by more than twofold. We identify three distinct components in understanding information use: the objective features of information architecture; the subjective mechanisms involving cognitive biases (i.e., over-/under-reaction to irrelevant information features) and decision noise (i.e., heterogeneity); and the moderating role of information user typology. Context should also be taken into account. The article explores how these findings relate to current societal challenges and emphasizes the potential of mixed-methods, multisample, and/or multisite research in advancing knowledge in this area.

The analysis is based on empirical papers citing Provan and Kenis (2008) as the seminal article on the governance of networks. We synthesize key findings on the modes of network governance, contingency factors, and network-level tensions. The review provides insights into how the contingency theory of network governance has developed into an established and recognized research agenda in the last 15?years. We conclude that the governance of organizational networks as a vocabulary has been adopted in the management and organization sciences literature to explain organizational networks' development, functioning, and effectiveness. However, further theoretical development and testing are warranted to inform the practice of network governance, particularly when, how, and why to use institutions and structures of authority and collaboration to allocate resources and coordinate and control joint action of groups of organizations.

AB  - Abstract The current work explores three potential facilitators of judicial performance. Participants in a state-wide survey of judicial officers (response rate?=?33.9 percent) completed self-report measures of self-efficacy, prosocial impact, and self-legitimacy as well as subjectively perceived performance. Objective performance data collected by the state court administrative office were then merged with the survey data. Latent variable analysis confirmed the three predictor constructs' separability, and although all four concepts were correlated, self-efficacy was the sole independent predictor of subjective performance. An unplanned mediation analysis suggested significant indirect effects of self-legitimacy and prosocial impact on subjectively assessed performance through self-efficacy. Regarding objective performance, self-efficacy emerged as the only significant correlate or predictor. The research therefore empirically demonstrates the empirical distinctiveness of self-efficacy, prosocial impact, and self-legitimacy and provides some exploratory support for a causal model whereby self-efficacy provides the proximal impact on performance but is itself facilitated by prosocial impact and self-legitimacy.

AB  - Abstract Change communication is a critical dimension for leading digital transformation. Existing literature predominantly theorizes change communication as part of the earliest stages of the transformation, but how it evolves over time to remain relevant in this context is understudied. We address this shortcoming through a four-year study of a digital transformation initiative in a local government's health care department. Drawing on a narrative perspective, we offer a processual account and describe the ongoing communicative work of public managers as they attempt to shape frontline workers' expectations of digital transformation. We theorize three narrative types?aspirational, setback, and persistence?that work as communicative resources in dealing with hopes, delays, and emerging concerns. Our article contributes to the literature on leading digital transformation in the public sector by providing a narrative perspective that details how managers produce narratives, navigate existing ones, and tailor them to emerging concerns.

AB  - Abstract As a design science, public administration is focused on addressing real-world problems. However, within public administration argument and evidence on the relevance of academic research to practice agendas is equivocal. We investigate the ?academic?practitioner divide? using computational social science techniques to identify the topics of ?academic,? ?academic?practitioner,? and practitioner corpora over a 25-year period. Topic modeling results of the 50 topics identified in each of these corpora suggest that the topics of academics and practitioners have more differences than similarities: nearly seven-tenths of the identified topics differ between the practice corpus and the academic and academic?practice corpora. Corpus linguistics analysis is applied to contrast the keyness of topics over time, and the results confirm the largely different agendas of the corpora albeit with some convergence on governance and outcomes. Corpora examined in this article is largely suggestive of a lack of relevance of academic research to practice agendas.

AB  - Abstract Constant policy growth can overburden bureaucracies if implementation capacities are not expanded in lockstep with policy production. This development may undermine policy effectiveness and hence the long-term legitimacy of democracies. This article provides a systematic analysis of this phenomenon. We demonstrate that (i) overburdening is a general trend in advanced democracies; (ii) the extent of overburdening varies by the institutional context in which policy makers operate; and that, in consequence, (iii) countries' bureaucracies differ in their distance (or closeness) to the ?tipping point? after which additional policies do more harm than good. We provide information on the ratio between the policies up for implementation and the bureaucratic capacities available for 21 OECD countries over a period of 45?years (1976?2020), focusing on the areas of environmental and social policy as two major areas of governmental intervention. Bayesian analyses and background interviews serve to illuminate the reasons for and consequences of overburdened bureaucracies.

AB  - Abstract State and local governments in the United States are the implementation agents for a vast swath of federal policies. As the country embarks on an unprecedented foray into fiscal federalism to combat climate change, we face a stark reality: many local governments are not ready. Drawing from recent data and evidence on local sustainability activities, we argue policy makers and managers at all levels of governance need to apply the lessons learned over the last two decades of subnational climate efforts. For local government managers working in the 21st century, climate change will likely be a defining social dilemma of their lifetimes. After years of inaction, the United States has taken a major step in trying to meet its greenhouse-gas mitigation pledges. But implementation requires understanding both the opportunities and opportunity costs posed by such generational investments.

AB  - Abstract Public management scholars argue that collective action problems (e.g., incentives to free-ride on the efforts of others or shirk agreements) threaten the feasibility of intergovernmental cooperation. Drawing on collective action theory, this article examines factors associated with overcoming free-riding incentives and provides evidence challenging the idea that governments are prone to such strategic behavior. The empirical analysis of a national Danish purchasing group demonstrates how coercion is not necessary to induce subnational governments to incur private costs to join the group and, despite opportunity and incentive to free-ride, contribute to its production of joint purchasing agreements?collective goods whose quality depends on the staff resources and expertise the participating governments contribute to their production. Further, multivariate analyses find that governments are more likely to help produce these collective goods when they receive more of their benefits, face lower contribution costs, and receive stronger social norm pressures from peers.
